            <title>XLMPool - Stellar Lumens passive mining about 1% APR</title>
            <description>&lt;html&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The essence of a method comes down to the fact that in Stellar Lumens network (also as well as
                in the Steemit, for example) there is a planned annual inflation in 1% of the general issue of tokens of
                XLM. And holders of coins of XLM can vote, having specified the address which according to them has to
                receive Stellar coins, geneneriruyemy in the course of inflation.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;http://i.imgur.com/SDhRng3.png&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;If the chosen address receives more than 0.05% of votes of all holders of coins, then it will
                receive every week a share from issue of new tokens.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;And here organizers of XLMPool have thought up the interesting scheme - to all who vote for
                their pool, they automatically distribute the coins received by a pool. In fact XLMPool is a certain
                analog of classical pools of a joint mining, only for participation in work of this pool no computing
                capacities are necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;There is enough once in a standard desktop purse to specify pool address as the recipient the
                generated by a network of coins - and every week the pool will list you your share of income:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;http://i.imgur.com/nGBxqNW.jpg&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;As XLMPool pool is the only thing now for whom more than 0.05% of holders of coins of network
                have voted, he receives all coins generated in this network. Therefore approximate income on a bullet
                makes 1% per annum.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Of course, it isn&#39;t a lot from the point of view of specially to buy XLM for receiving
                passive income. But if you already have these coins and you don&#39;t plan them to sell - be connected
                to a pool and begin to receive let small, but stable passive income in Stellar Lumens network.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;table&gt;
                &lt;tr&gt;

            <title>Bitjob ICO – Big Ideas, Little Details in Mistake-laden Whitepaper + Senior Staff Combative After I
                Bring Up Mistakes
            </title>
            <description>The [Bitjob ICO](http://bitjob.io), a student freelance marketplace aimed at China and India,
                has set out with a big idea, but without knowing any of the specifics relating to operations, its too
                difficult to know whether this ICO has staying power.

                When I do these reports, the first thing I do is hop in either Telegram or Slack to have a chat with the
                founders, developers and or community manager. It’s an essential part of my DD process to ask questions
                I have about the project and also to see how and what sort of answers I’m given. My questions come from
                issues in the whitepaper and other factors which I could see arising later in the future for these young
                companies.

                When I first started talking with the Bitjob team, I wanted to know a few things. First, how will it
                compare to other existing competitors, namely Upwork and Freelancer.com. The biggest advantages for a
                crypto-version of these services would be their fees. Upwork charges a flat percentage fee which reduces
                as the client pays over a certain level for the lifetime of the contract. “Specifically, Upwork charges
                the freelancer a fee of: 20% for the first $500 billed with the client. 10% for lifetime billings with
                the client between $500.01 and $10,000.” From the Upwork website.

                ![Upwork
                Fees](https://smarticoinvestor.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screenshot-2017-08-14-14.06.46.png)

                When I asked Bitjob about their fees, [Elad Kofman, CMO and
                Co-founder](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elad-kofman-36892782/), told me that they would not disclose
                their fees publically, but that I should trust them that would be lower and the service would be
                cheaper. This line of response was similar during my entire enquiry. I would ask for specifics and Elad
                would respond in a very general way about the efficacy of their model without ever providing any
                details.

                Specifically, I asked for the following fees: “full fee structure for both users and employers, fiat to
                STU fee, Stu to Fiat fee, subscription fees, BJE.M fees, DPR fees.” In response Elad gave me the
                following answer, “We won&#39;t publish any info about the fee structure. We have solid numbers on our
                business model, but it is too early at the moment - You can rely on the fact that the fees will be
                cheaper than Fiverr &amp; Upwork.” He then added “BUT - as experienced businessmen - we understand that
                giving you ‘numbers’ that will make you satisfied, numbers that may change in the instant future due to
                countless reasons - is making a fool out of ourselves and not respecting you in any way.” !

                [](https://smarticoinvestor.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screenshot-2017-08-14-14.07.50.png)

                **Unfortunately, I can’t rely on someone’s word when determining whether I want to invest money in a
                company or not. Concrete details, especially concerning how the company Bitjob plans to be able to fund
                operations, further development of the platform and expansion. **

                Furthermore, it’s Bitjob’s responsibility to provide their full business plan to investors, as they are
                the ones trying to raise several million dollars. They need to demonstrate the viability of their
                project and provide investors the necessary information to conduct their own due diligence.

                When it comes to the whitepaper itself, I’ll let the following picture sum up my view.
                ![](https://smarticoinvestor.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screenshot-2017-08-10-23.59.26.png)

                A large portion of their whitepaper was completely negated and contained false, old details. The team
                even admitted that these details were false and the whitepaper contained a mistake. I can’t review a
                whitepaper which is not up to date and doesn’t contain all factual information.

                When I brought up the issue with the team as well as pointing out that their wp contained very little
                details, I was met with what seemed to me as annoyance and aggression from [Bogdan Fiedur, CTO and
                co-founder](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bogdanfiedur/). Instead of thanking me for finding the issue and
                then offering to send me a new updated WP, the senior Bitjob staff member responded to me with
                hostility. After he asked me if I had written any whitepapers (this is irrelevant, I’m not the one
                raising money), he told me “Obviously I would like to learn how one writes white paper without errors.”
                I told him that I wasn’t the one trying to raise money during an ICO and he responded “I&#39;m just
                wanting to see if your money is where your moth is.”

                ![Bitjob ICO
                3](https://smarticoinvestor.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screenshot-2017-08-10-23.58.52.png) ![Bitjob
                ICO 2](https://smarticoinvestor.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screenshot-2017-08-10-23.58.55-1.png)
                ![](https://smarticoinvestor.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screenshot-2017-08-10-23.58.59-1.png)

                **I’m still surprised that Bitjob lets a senior member of their staff talk to an investor and interested
                party this way.**

                Bitjob’s lack of transparency and hostile responses are indicative of a larger issue with the company.
                These should be trivial matters for a company trying to do what they want to do. Ultimately, I still
                have no response to my answers and I hope that others will ask the same. They need to provide these
                details, even if its preliminary.

                Because of their actions, I can’t in good faith summarize and or analyze any of their whitepaper due to
                the following discrepancies: the whitepaper is filled with errors and mistakes, which the team has
                admitted themselves, the team was combative about providing information on fees and other issues which
                could affect long term success, and senior staff are able to aggressively speak to interested parties
                while representing the company. Until these serious issues are resolved, I will not be reviewing their
                ICO.

            <title>Lisk / Azure - PT II</title>
            <description>
                ![download.png](https://steemitimages.com/DQmdEG6iwmBog9TezwvyQddE4nJK4YyM5tQXPLw9rAFy3yi/download.png)

                Part 2 - Microsoft Azure, BaaS &amp; Dapps

                Microsoft has partnered with the blockchain project Lisk, to integrate Lisk into its Azure cloud
                computing services portfolio, providing developers with a BaaS (Blockchain as a Service) solution as a
                means to develop and deploy DApps (distributed applications). We&#39;ll discuss Lisk in more detail in a
                later section, for now though let&#39;s consider one of the areas where BaaS and DApps may show up in
                the MS product portfolio.

                Database applications are a prime candidate, where we could possibly see in the shorter to medium term a
                variety of database implementations with sidechains for various transaction types. The immutability of
                blockchain records will be particularly useful for transactions with compliance and/or auditing
                requirements, and the distributed nature of such solutions could provide the performance and stability
                benefits which are so critical to database applications.

                We&#39;ll pick up several more possibilities over the next postings in the series.

            <title>🔥 Other sites like Steemit!? I have found 4. Here is the list! Will they work? 🔥</title>
            <description>&lt;center&gt;![stme.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmTcs9f18eAzCwr3TAeGU6eCYvH2GWAPjfikaZTCpefrd1/stme.jpg)&lt;/center&gt;

                ### Do you want to know where else you can make money from blogging? Here is a small list of the
                possible competitors for Steem, that I collected today, after searching for other blockchain based
                social media sites.
                &lt;/br&gt;
                **Blockchain is rapidly developing and challenging &#34;old&#34; social media sites like Facebook,
                Twitter and their purpose is to reward users or content creators that can bring more readers or giving
                value to the site.**

                **Looks like Steemit is still the biggest and fastest growing site of all, but you never know in these
                fastchanging world. Just take a look.**
                ### Today I made a little search and found these similar sites:

                &lt;center&gt;https://scrypto.io/uploads/logo_image/logo.png&lt;/center&gt;
                ## [Scrypto](scrypto.io)
                #### It will reward you in different cryptocurrencies, they say they can pay in 100 cryptos after the

            <title>KCN The price of bitcoin has set a new record - $4200</title>
            <description>Bitcoin conquered the $4200 mark. According to the charts of Coinmarketcap, this price was set
                in the morning of Sunday, August 13. The bitcoin’s market capitalization exceeded $68 billion. Analysts
                noted the increased investors’ interest for bitcoin, after it has successfully survived the fork on
                August 1. Among other favorable factors are the upcoming activation of the SegWit protocol and the
                increased demand for the cryptocurrency on the Japanese markets. Bitcoin has demonstrated more than 300%
                growth, as at the beginning of the year its price was less than $1000. The price predictions of the
                bitcoin experts vary, converging to the fact that bitcoin will retrace the stages of gold in its
                cryptocurrency evolution, becoming in time a costly benchmark, rather than a small change.

            <title>We MUST use our numbers to edit this wikipedia page for Steemit! It unfairly mentions how &#34;Others
                point out that steem might be a Ponzi scheme&#34; and needs A LOT of updating to EDUCATE the public on
                how steem REALLY works, and include all our achievements!
            </title>
            <description>Please take a second to look over the very unfair wikipedia page for steemit with barely any
                real information about how steem blockchain even works! We should all do our part to help edit this to
                become more fair and highlight our accomplishments as both a social media website AND a blockchain!
                https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steemit
                ![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmW6zTUhG4tE6Xmjn8FkMPE1DoDzMMSrdEQoxCJW8NeurX/image.png)

                Look at this wikipedia page! It has obviously been written or edited by someone who doesn&#39;t even
                understand how steemit works or how SERIOUS it is! I Understand that this may just be a result of
                steemit having been brand new last year and you have to have a healthy skepticism of a new ICO or
                website like this promising to pay users to post when no other social media had ever been able to do
                this. And of course people will fear the unknown and call any successful new crypto currency system a
                ponzi scheme, but the ending of this post &#34;Controversy&#34; is very unfair because all it does is
                place doubt in the minds of someone READING about steemit. And people reading about steemit on wikipedia
                are USUALLY going to be all the people who are thinking about signing up! They&#39;re checking wikipedia
                to read up on it to se if it is worth their time and that bullshit attack on steemit is unfounded and
                simply an attack, it needs to be removed. Why do they even have to include a &#34;controversy&#34; page?
                I bet there are a lot of other wikipedia pages for websites without a controversy page that SHOULD have
                one but Steemit has NO signs of being a ponzi so we don&#39;t deserve that unfair comment like a black
                mark on our wiki page! It is NOT FAIR to the READERS to just MENTION that SOME PEOPLE think steemit is a
                ponzi scheme as if that has any merit or is worth mentioning at all! Some people think they are the only
                person that exists and everyone else is part of their imagination, doesnt mean you need to mention it!
                Some people think a lot of things, I didnt know we were just putting in HEARSAY as wikipedia citations!
                In fact that is a great reason to get that sentence removed! It&#39;s heresay! And it&#39;s also not
                cited, &#34;Some&#34; people? Well who said it and why is their opinion important and what do they say
                now a year later?

                ![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmQsNRVV6PdXk7HANxmgZYr9VXeKisa4wuqctTjWAiBWtz/image.png)

                I understand that when steemit first came out people were skeptical, but its been OVER a year now, and
                its getting really annoying like when some people are still calling bitcoin a ponzi scheme, it&#39;s
                just ignorant and annoying. And I know steemit is still relatively new, but the time for editing this
                wikipedia article has come because Steemit has proven itself! And we have also proven all sorts of
                things as a community, I mean we haven&#39;t even had payout problems! People have payout problems on
                poloniex and all sorts of exchanges and websites and yet steemit pays people like clockwork without fail
                and no one ever gives us credit for that! Steemit is also never down and no one ever gives us credit for
                that either ....It&#39;s time we get aggressive with our advertising and promotion of steemit! If we don&#39;t
                get aggressive then almost noone will ever find out about us because we have such a small budget for
                ads! We could be having a million new users join a month if some of us tried, and we could be getting
                bigger user growth faster if we ALL try! We ALL have the power of marketing and can each single handedly
                bring 1000 people to steemit!

                ![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmPt9fpbeUnPvN3DwV2hpBNnJKV5wo7JVqz3V7ufMTXhUq/image.png)

                I had been actually looking for a reason to bring up these articles. i recently had the spontaneous idea
                of &#34;Wikipedia Marketing&#34; and I thought to myself&#34; Ok Wikipedia Marketing MUST already be a
                thing, there&#39;s probably even guides for it&#34; and I found one on inc.com .
                https://www.inc.com/managing/articles/201001/wikipedia.html It gives a great list of ways you can
                ethicaly and professionally add information about your new business without crossing that thin line into
                Spam, linking to thid partu sites, starting out by creating a stub, using the discussion page which we
                will excell with our strength in numbers, volunteering to edit other blockchain and crypto related posts
                on wikipedia, and other organic methods to create high quality wiki pages for your business etc. We can
                learn from it while finding ways to improve this article on steemit WHICH needs to be A LOT longer and
                more detailed. I&#39;m talking several pages long with FULL descriptions of EVERYTHING steemit uses to
                work! This will require an article on Steempower, Steam Dollars, Delegation, Voting Power, and another
                article on Witnesses and so on, it will be easy to come up with many articles and maybe separate pages
                to then link back to the main steemit page, maybe even add steemit links to pages about Bitcoin or
                Blockchain etc. We should be adding information and links about steemit on non steemit but blockchain
                related pages, like on the Blockchain page itself, we will be able to make true statements about how
                Steem has the MOST transactions or how its the most energy efficient or has most users, we have all
                sorts of records we can use on the crypto currency opr blockchain wiki to get the name steemit to just
                show up more! Wikipedia can bring us MILLIONS of users if people researching Bitcoin and Blockchain and
                CryptoCurrency wiki pages start seeing the name Steemit and Steem blockchain everywhere!

                ![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmPKQBPnxEvaUxDrCuCET4cHAu6LAF2T2JzfNVyEpYPVY4/image.png)

                if just 1000 of us bring 1000 people each to steemit that&#39;s 1 million new users! And look at
                @jerrybanfield he has definitely brought MORE than 1000 users to steemit, possibly even 10,000 because I
                mean he&#39;s got over 10,000 followers and got most of them in the last few months from his social
                media youtube facebook campaigns! Because when you get people to sign up for steemit they tend to just
                follow you first. So just imagine how much money you can make from promoting steemit for FREE on social
                media!! We all win! a 360 win as Alex Jones would say. And this wikipedia page can be a powerful tool to
                promote steemit and since wikipedia marketing is an established practice, we can use it and we can
                create many new pages to link back to it, but the important part is that we stay organic, authentic,
                sincere and ethical! And remember that just 1 person can use marketing to change the world even if its
                just by saving money and using some of it to build a hospital! Maybe the idea of one person changing the
                world was not as posible before the internet, but now one person can do a lot with the computer and
                internet as a Force Multiplier, letting one man have the power of 10 men!

                ![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmexDzAkLs6hqGNW6N5UamzE9rdJYoWSJJ12wvckoeCwar/image.png)

                So let&#39;s start signing up to wikipedia, making changes on the steemit page, and add more accurate
                information and try to Polish the image of steemit, because this page was obviously edited or partially
                written by some people with some negative opinions about steemit or why else would they include that
                unfounded and unfair &#34;possible ponzi scheme&#34; hearsay comment? We can do better than this! Let&#39;s
                be &#34;respectfully&#34; aggressive but also legally ruthless. Hey if people can patent Aids medicine
                and raise the price 1000 percent, and if people can legally make billions of dollars from the Invasion
                of Iraq in 2003, then we should not feel guilty editing a fucking wikipedia page to promote our
                DECENTRALIZED social media site which can CHANGE THE WORLD FOR THE BETTER and SO WHAT if we fucking make
                some money doing it....everyone who invested in bitcoin early on DESERVED to become millionaires or
                billionaires! PLEASE do not throw a wrench in our progress by LIMITING yourself! BE AGGRESSIVE because
                STEEMIT DESERVES TO WIN. it will raise the living standards of billions of human beings and potentially
                END POVERTY on this fucking planet JUST from abolishing criminal inflationary monetary practices ALONE!

                Ok sorry for my outburst above, but I get pissed when I realize how global poverty could have been wiped
                out before I was even born, and then again several times during my lifetime, so let&#39;s just not waste
                anymore time because lifting 2 billion humans out of poverty benefits the RICH more than the poor!
                Imagine 2 billion more people making tens of thousands of dollars a year instead of just hundreds, theyd
                be benefitting their employers and making money for the global economy and theyd be able to pay so much
                more in taxes so governments should like that to. Now this next thought doesn&#39;t relate very much to
                what Im talking about here, but I just have a great anger in me, I don&#39;t want to promote the
                community doing immoral unethical things to grow, but I see so many people getting ahead doing things
                that are seen as &#34;immoral&#34; or &#34;unethical&#34; and I feel like we should do whatever we can
                to grow steem blockchain as well because it can&#39;t hurt anyone and it&#39;s only going to benefit
                humanity and the planet ....sorry to anyone who is assuming I am suggesting we...I dunno...i really don&#39;t..it
                could be anything! I know we want to represent steemit well, we shouldn&#39;t &#34;spam&#34; social
                media to promote steemit, but it&#39;s not spam if we all simply give authentic comments all at the same
                time!

                Blockchain is the future, Steem is the best blockchain for the masses, and that steemit.com only helps
                people around the world, and since I have discovered a Niche, an ability to make money off of helping
                others, that i should continue this path! You must honestly want to help someone, zero in on someone
                from Africa, India, Latin America (venezuelans need our help badly) any steemit user you see in the
                developing world, please find one you like, promote them like I have for @tj4real and @bania and @xpency
                (who i thought was dead after leaving steemit , lol hes back though and was just sick) make a post about
                them! send them some SBD and help them out and make a post about it! You will then make the money back,
                and create a cycle of generosity!
