            <title>🔥 Other sites like Steemit!? I have found 4. Here is the list! Will they work? 🔥</title>
            <description>&lt;center&gt;![stme.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmTcs9f18eAzCwr3TAeGU6eCYvH2GWAPjfikaZTCpefrd1/stme.jpg)&lt;/center&gt;

                ### Do you want to know where else you can make money from blogging? Here is a small list of the
                possible competitors for Steem, that I collected today, after searching for other blockchain based
                social media sites.
                &lt;/br&gt;
                **Blockchain is rapidly developing and challenging &#34;old&#34; social media sites like Facebook,
                Twitter and their purpose is to reward users or content creators that can bring more readers or giving
                value to the site.**

                **Looks like Steemit is still the biggest and fastest growing site of all, but you never know in these
                fastchanging world. Just take a look.**
                ### Today I made a little search and found these similar sites:

                &lt;center&gt;https://scrypto.io/uploads/logo_image/logo.png&lt;/center&gt;
                ## [Scrypto](scrypto.io)
                #### It will reward you in different cryptocurrencies, they say they can pay in 100 cryptos after the
                full release, so it might be a good idea to have an account there.
                &lt;br&gt;
                &lt;br&gt;
                https://s3.amazonaws.com/patreon_public_assets/toolbox/patreon.png
                ## [Patreon](https://patreon.com/invite/jvnvqo)

                #### This is a bit different site. Here you do your job and curators can subscribe to your service,
                photo, novel writing or whatever. They will contribute to your work monthly or after each post. You can
                decide. I do not know if this would work or not but sure worth to try. Having their ongoing support
                means you spend less time thinking about business, and more time creating.

                ## [Synereo](http://synereo.com)

                #### It is still under development but you can pre-register now. They say on their website:
                &gt; Synereo is developing tools which allow content creators to easily monetize original works without
                having to turn their channels into advertisment real estate, while granting their followers the
                opportunity to be rewarded for getting the word out.

                ## [Yoyow](http://yoyow.org)

                #### It is like Steem for the Chinese community but I could not get much info about it hence I cannot
                speak or read Chinese.

            <title>KCN The price of bitcoin has set a new record - $4200</title>
            <description>Bitcoin conquered the $4200 mark. According to the charts of Coinmarketcap, this price was set
                in the morning of Sunday, August 13. The bitcoin’s market capitalization exceeded $68 billion. Analysts
                noted the increased investors’ interest for bitcoin, after it has successfully survived the fork on
                August 1. Among other favorable factors are the upcoming activation of the SegWit protocol and the
                increased demand for the cryptocurrency on the Japanese markets. Bitcoin has demonstrated more than 300%
                growth, as at the beginning of the year its price was less than $1000. The price predictions of the
                bitcoin experts vary, converging to the fact that bitcoin will retrace the stages of gold in its
                cryptocurrency evolution, becoming in time a costly benchmark, rather than a small change.

            <title>We MUST use our numbers to edit this wikipedia page for Steemit! It unfairly mentions how &#34;Others
                point out that steem might be a Ponzi scheme&#34; and needs A LOT of updating to EDUCATE the public on
                how steem REALLY works, and include all our achievements!
            </title>
            <description>Please take a second to look over the very unfair wikipedia page for steemit with barely any
                real information about how steem blockchain even works! We should all do our part to help edit this to
                become more fair and highlight our accomplishments as both a social media website AND a blockchain!
                https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steemit
                ![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmW6zTUhG4tE6Xmjn8FkMPE1DoDzMMSrdEQoxCJW8NeurX/image.png)

                Look at this wikipedia page! It has obviously been written or edited by someone who doesn&#39;t even
                understand how steemit works or how SERIOUS it is! I Understand that this may just be a result of
                steemit having been brand new last year and you have to have a healthy skepticism of a new ICO or
                website like this promising to pay users to post when no other social media had ever been able to do
                this. And of course people will fear the unknown and call any successful new crypto currency system a
                ponzi scheme, but the ending of this post &#34;Controversy&#34; is very unfair because all it does is
                place doubt in the minds of someone READING about steemit. And people reading about steemit on wikipedia
                are USUALLY going to be all the people who are thinking about signing up! They&#39;re checking wikipedia
                to read up on it to se if it is worth their time and that bullshit attack on steemit is unfounded and
                simply an attack, it needs to be removed. Why do they even have to include a &#34;controversy&#34; page?
                I bet there are a lot of other wikipedia pages for websites without a controversy page that SHOULD have
                one but Steemit has NO signs of being a ponzi so we don&#39;t deserve that unfair comment like a black
                mark on our wiki page! It is NOT FAIR to the READERS to just MENTION that SOME PEOPLE think steemit is a
                ponzi scheme as if that has any merit or is worth mentioning at all! Some people think they are the only
                person that exists and everyone else is part of their imagination, doesnt mean you need to mention it!
                Some people think a lot of things, I didnt know we were just putting in HEARSAY as wikipedia citations!
                In fact that is a great reason to get that sentence removed! It&#39;s heresay! And it&#39;s also not
                cited, &#34;Some&#34; people? Well who said it and why is their opinion important and what do they say
                now a year later?

                ![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmQsNRVV6PdXk7HANxmgZYr9VXeKisa4wuqctTjWAiBWtz/image.png)

                I understand that when steemit first came out people were skeptical, but its been OVER a year now, and
                its getting really annoying like when some people are still calling bitcoin a ponzi scheme, it&#39;s
                just ignorant and annoying. And I know steemit is still relatively new, but the time for editing this
                wikipedia article has come because Steemit has proven itself! And we have also proven all sorts of
                things as a community, I mean we haven&#39;t even had payout problems! People have payout problems on
                poloniex and all sorts of exchanges and websites and yet steemit pays people like clockwork without fail
                and no one ever gives us credit for that! Steemit is also never down and no one ever gives us credit for
                that either ....It&#39;s time we get aggressive with our advertising and promotion of steemit! If we don&#39;t
                get aggressive then almost noone will ever find out about us because we have such a small budget for
                ads! We could be having a million new users join a month if some of us tried, and we could be getting
                bigger user growth faster if we ALL try! We ALL have the power of marketing and can each single handedly
                bring 1000 people to steemit!

                ![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmPt9fpbeUnPvN3DwV2hpBNnJKV5wo7JVqz3V7ufMTXhUq/image.png)

                I had been actually looking for a reason to bring up these articles. i recently had the spontaneous idea
                of &#34;Wikipedia Marketing&#34; and I thought to myself&#34; Ok Wikipedia Marketing MUST already be a
                thing, there&#39;s probably even guides for it&#34; and I found one on inc.com .
                https://www.inc.com/managing/articles/201001/wikipedia.html It gives a great list of ways you can
                ethicaly and professionally add information about your new business without crossing that thin line into
                Spam, linking to thid partu sites, starting out by creating a stub, using the discussion page which we
                will excell with our strength in numbers, volunteering to edit other blockchain and crypto related posts
                on wikipedia, and other organic methods to create high quality wiki pages for your business etc. We can
                learn from it while finding ways to improve this article on steemit WHICH needs to be A LOT longer and
                more detailed. I&#39;m talking several pages long with FULL descriptions of EVERYTHING steemit uses to
                work! This will require an article on Steempower, Steam Dollars, Delegation, Voting Power, and another
                article on Witnesses and so on, it will be easy to come up with many articles and maybe separate pages
                to then link back to the main steemit page, maybe even add steemit links to pages about Bitcoin or
                Blockchain etc. We should be adding information and links about steemit on non steemit but blockchain
                related pages, like on the Blockchain page itself, we will be able to make true statements about how
                Steem has the MOST transactions or how its the most energy efficient or has most users, we have all
                sorts of records we can use on the crypto currency opr blockchain wiki to get the name steemit to just
                show up more! Wikipedia can bring us MILLIONS of users if people researching Bitcoin and Blockchain and
                CryptoCurrency wiki pages start seeing the name Steemit and Steem blockchain everywhere!

                ![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmPKQBPnxEvaUxDrCuCET4cHAu6LAF2T2JzfNVyEpYPVY4/image.png)

                if just 1000 of us bring 1000 people each to steemit that&#39;s 1 million new users! And look at
                @jerrybanfield he has definitely brought MORE than 1000 users to steemit, possibly even 10,000 because I
                mean he&#39;s got over 10,000 followers and got most of them in the last few months from his social
                media youtube facebook campaigns! Because when you get people to sign up for steemit they tend to just
                follow you first. So just imagine how much money you can make from promoting steemit for FREE on social
                media!! We all win! a 360 win as Alex Jones would say. And this wikipedia page can be a powerful tool to
                promote steemit and since wikipedia marketing is an established practice, we can use it and we can
                create many new pages to link back to it, but the important part is that we stay organic, authentic,
                sincere and ethical! And remember that just 1 person can use marketing to change the world even if its
                just by saving money and using some of it to build a hospital! Maybe the idea of one person changing the
                world was not as posible before the internet, but now one person can do a lot with the computer and
                internet as a Force Multiplier, letting one man have the power of 10 men!

                ![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmexDzAkLs6hqGNW6N5UamzE9rdJYoWSJJ12wvckoeCwar/image.png)

                So let&#39;s start signing up to wikipedia, making changes on the steemit page, and add more accurate
                information and try to Polish the image of steemit, because this page was obviously edited or partially
                written by some people with some negative opinions about steemit or why else would they include that
                unfounded and unfair &#34;possible ponzi scheme&#34; hearsay comment? We can do better than this! Let&#39;s
                be &#34;respectfully&#34; aggressive but also legally ruthless. Hey if people can patent Aids medicine
                and raise the price 1000 percent, and if people can legally make billions of dollars from the Invasion
                of Iraq in 2003, then we should not feel guilty editing a fucking wikipedia page to promote our
                DECENTRALIZED social media site which can CHANGE THE WORLD FOR THE BETTER and SO WHAT if we fucking make
                some money doing it....everyone who invested in bitcoin early on DESERVED to become millionaires or
                billionaires! PLEASE do not throw a wrench in our progress by LIMITING yourself! BE AGGRESSIVE because
                STEEMIT DESERVES TO WIN. it will raise the living standards of billions of human beings and potentially
                END POVERTY on this fucking planet JUST from abolishing criminal inflationary monetary practices ALONE!

                Ok sorry for my outburst above, but I get pissed when I realize how global poverty could have been wiped
                out before I was even born, and then again several times during my lifetime, so let&#39;s just not waste
                anymore time because lifting 2 billion humans out of poverty benefits the RICH more than the poor!
                Imagine 2 billion more people making tens of thousands of dollars a year instead of just hundreds, theyd
                be benefitting their employers and making money for the global economy and theyd be able to pay so much
                more in taxes so governments should like that to. Now this next thought doesn&#39;t relate very much to
                what Im talking about here, but I just have a great anger in me, I don&#39;t want to promote the
                community doing immoral unethical things to grow, but I see so many people getting ahead doing things
                that are seen as &#34;immoral&#34; or &#34;unethical&#34; and I feel like we should do whatever we can
                to grow steem blockchain as well because it can&#39;t hurt anyone and it&#39;s only going to benefit
                humanity and the planet ....sorry to anyone who is assuming I am suggesting we...I dunno...i really don&#39;t..it
                could be anything! I know we want to represent steemit well, we shouldn&#39;t &#34;spam&#34; social
                media to promote steemit, but it&#39;s not spam if we all simply give authentic comments all at the same
                time!

                Blockchain is the future, Steem is the best blockchain for the masses, and that steemit.com only helps
                people around the world, and since I have discovered a Niche, an ability to make money off of helping
                others, that i should continue this path! You must honestly want to help someone, zero in on someone
                from Africa, India, Latin America (venezuelans need our help badly) any steemit user you see in the
                developing world, please find one you like, promote them like I have for @tj4real and @bania and @xpency
                (who i thought was dead after leaving steemit , lol hes back though and was just sick) make a post about
                them! send them some SBD and help them out and make a post about it! You will then make the money back,
                and create a cycle of generosity!

            <title>BTC-E Will Distribute 55% of User Assets, Remaining 45% are Currency-specific IoU Tokens</title>
            <description>
                ![btc-e-logo.png](https://steemitimages.com/DQmY1a23o37rCoRamMTQGhuYLkzii3TqK3eMT2xvDUu7hme/btc-e-logo.png)

                The ongoing BTC-E exchange situation continues to spark debates among cryptocurrency enthusiasts. In the
                previous update, the company announced the creation of an IOU token and reduction of customer balances.
                After getting a lot of community feedback, it appears those plans have been changed once again. It is
                good to see the company work on new solutions, though.

                NEW BTC-E UPDATE OFFERS SOME GOOD NEWS

                Ever since the BTC-E exchange platform went offline and the domain was seized by government officials,
                cryptocurrency users have been asking many questions. The main pressing issue is whether or not customer
                funds are safe. For now, that is not entirely the case, although the BTC-E team claims they have access
                to roughly 555% of all customer funds right now. The remaining money has officially been seized by
                government officials and law enforcement agencies, with no chance of recovering it, by the look of
                things.This leaves a big financial hole to fill by the company.

                In the previous update shared with the world, it appears the BTC-E team would give all users a balance
                haircut. More specifically, the missing 45% of funds would be deducted from user balances and they would
                receive an IOU token in return. Every single token would be valued at US$1 and can be redeemed at market
                rates at any given time, assuming there is enough demand for them. This proposal didn’t sit all too well
                with the cryptocurrency community, though.

                BTC-E received a lot of viable feedback from the community and came u up with a new plan. The goal of
                the company is to treat all users fairly and ensure the missing funds can be recuperated in one way or
                another. According to their new plan, there will be a recalculation of all currency balances. This will
                be done by taking the available assets into account as well. This means 55% of all current balances will
                be credited as currency immediately, with the remaining 45% left in the form of a specific currency
                token.

                All currencies will get their associated “IOU” token, which can be traded on the exchange free of
                charge. These tokens will not have a fixed market price, which means there is plenty of room for
                arbitrage opportunities and recovering some initial losses pretty quickly. However, they will never have
                more value than their face value, which means the room for financial gain is pretty limited unless you
                step in at the right time. It is a fair plan, all things considered, and one that makes it clearer to
                users as to which outstanding balances they have yet to recuperate.

                The current plan by BTC-E is to eventually redeem all outstanding tokens, although it is hard to tell
                how long this process will take. If the Bitfinex IOU situation is to be considered, the process can be
                settled as quickly as a few months from now. It’s far from an ideal situation, but it guarantees BTC-E
                users will eventually get their money back in one way or another. It’s good customers get the option to
                either trade at face value or try to get rid of them below the normal price in an effort to move all
                funds out of the exchange sooner rather than later.

                BTC-E users who had 1 BTC in their account balance will receive 0.55 BTC and 0.45 BTCT in the near
                future. The actual cryptocurrency funds can be transferred out immediately if the users prefer to take
                that course of action. Remaining tokens will be available for trade or exchange at face value at a later
                unspecified date. It is a simple process, yet it remains a bit unclear when users will be able to access
                their balances. This plan by BTC-E seems pretty solid, to say the least, although it remains to be seen
                how long it takes to recover all missing funds accordingly.

            <title>Is this $4400 Bitcoin day?</title>
            <description>May may REGRET selling their Bitcoins for $4000 if the Bitcoin momentum train continues to
                rocket up higher.

                So far, Bitcoin is the King of Cryptos, no doubt.

                Many are selling their Ripple XRP and their other losing Cryptos now to jump on the Bitcoin momentum
                train.

                People are lined up on the bid side and FIGHTING to get Bitcoins, still.

                Amazing to watch!

            <title>Bitcoin is the new gold? Then why is it valued 113x less?</title>
            <description>https://s20.postimg.org/j3aszskv1/Bitcoin_Gold.jpg

                Bitcoin and Gold have been compared in many ways and more and more investors are now seeing that the two
                have a LOT in common:

                * They store value
                * They are seen as a hedge to the &#34;system&#34; when things turn bad (Financial Crisis, War...)
                * Like Gold, Bitcoin is not controlled by one Central Bank or country
                * There are a finite number of gold and Bitcoin which makes your asset not subject to dilution

                *&#34;I think the world is starting to realise that, just like gold is a good hedge, bitcoin is a great
                hedge against the system because it’s outside the system,&#34;* says Bobby Lee, the CEO of BTCC, one of
                China&#39;s biggest bitcoin exchanges.

                During the last days, financial markets have gone south, whereas the Bitcoin keeps getting higher.


                Therefore the current Bull Market we are experiencing on Bitcoin might just be the beginning if we look
                at these 2 charts. If both of these assets serve the same purposes defined above then they should be
                valued more or less the same don&#39;t you think?

            <title>Mining Poll</title>

                ![9fab2d05918700b745b7ae369db11381.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmRqRTxQEH48xKR8RLCHgLaqtSGqT74pf1FEkgyS4bq8WG/9fab2d05918700b745b7ae369db11381.jpg)

                Mining or just a waste of resources and time?

                Just a small poll, I did a while ago some experiments mining Feathercoin and Worldcoin, just for fun and
                using the full node client. Nowadays it appears not really to make sense anymore, but well, doesn&#39;t
                hurt to give it a try.

                So what would be your suggestions for a single PC/GPU mining exercise, can be pooled or not. Any altcoin
                is of interest, Steem unfortunately does not seem to be possible anymore.

                Let the ideas come :)
